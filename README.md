# Motivation
FOllowing the Safari Books Online course "Professional RESTful API Design using Python Flask".
First thing is to see if the contens are upgradeable from year 2017 to 2018.
Security fixes following then.

# Warning
As of now to foreseeable future, there are security holes in libraries used in this rehearsal. Be warned.
